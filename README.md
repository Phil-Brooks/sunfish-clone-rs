## Overview

Sunfish is a simple, but strong chess engine, written in Python. This can be found [here](https://github.com/thomasahle/sunfish).

This is a clone of this converted to Rust as a learning exercise - the code is intended to be identical.

This contrasts with [Recursing's Rust port](https://github.com/Recursing/sunfish_rs) which is similar in principle, but is more of a rewrite using Rust's particular features.

### Status

The code has reached the point where it has all been cloned and the engine does run.

However, there is clearly soemthing not quite right! Its performance is worse than Sunfish and it does crash pretty often. Not unusual for a first iteration of a chess engine!
